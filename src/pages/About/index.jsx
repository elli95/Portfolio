            <p>Greetings! I'm Elise Marie Hogsnes, a passionate Front-end Developer from TÃ¸nsberg, Norway.</p>
            <p>
              I am a structured and solution-oriented individual who loves learning new things. With experience in React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript
              that allows me to build dynamic and responsive web applications that surpass user expectations. My skill set also includes CSS, HTML,
              Figma, WordPress, SASS, and Bootstrap, allowing me to create comprehensive and visually appealing user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities that keep me balanced and inspired. I love playing games, engaging in
              various crafts, and taking leisurely walks in the forest. I also have a passion for cooking and enjoy experimenting with new recipes.
              During the winter months, I cherish skiing trips with my family, enjoying the beautiful Norwegian landscapes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I recently graduated in front-end development from Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media. And I am currently on the lookout
              for new opportunities to apply my skills to engaging projects and work with other passionate professionals. If you're in need of a
              front-end developer who is dedicated to excel, let's get in <a href="#contact">touch!</a>
